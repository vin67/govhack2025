# Building a Digital Guardian in 48 Hours: The Complete Solo Hackathon Story

*A developer's journey through AI-assisted innovation, technical breakthroughs, and the messy reality of building something meaningful under pressure*

---

## The Spark: Why Solo Development with AI?

I decided to enter GovHack 2025 by myself. I was curious to see how far I could push the boundaries of solo development with Generative AI as my partner. Fresh from seeing the results of Andrew Ng's AI Builders event in the US, where a one-person team was among the winners, I wanted to test the same premise: can one person, amplified by AI, ideate, research, execute, and build something meaningful in a single weekend?

The answer, after 48 hours of intense coding, is a resounding yes. This is the story of that weekend - the breakthroughs, the frustrations, the 4 AM coffee moments, and the technical discoveries that emerged from the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence.

---

## Day 1 (Saturday 7 PM): The Hunt for a Problem Worth Solving

The hackathon kicked off at 7 PM. As the challenges were released, I began a rapid-fire session with Gemini, scanning the problem statements, exploring potential angles, and quickly discarding ideas I'd tackled in previous years. Last year my team won a national prize for an accessibility project; this time, I wanted a new challenge.

**"I went back and forth with the AI for a little while refining a set of problems that I thought were interesting and I hadn't done before."**

The concept that stuck was protecting vulnerable groups, especially the elderly, from the relentless onslaught of phone and SMS scams. I envisioned a multi-layered solution, but it had to be anchored by a simple, mobile-first interface.

**"Very interested in the concept of vulnerable groups, especially elderly people being protected from scams and alerts from their phones. I felt that this would be a multi-tier solution with many lines of defense but also had to be very simple, so I decided I wanted to use a mobile-first solution."**

But here came the first revelation: redefining what constitutes "government data."

### The Data Discovery Challenge

**"The next question was: how do I connect this to government data? The opportunity, I realised, was to redefine 'government datasets.' It's not just the clean, structured CSV files on data.gov.au; it's also the vast amount of semi-structured and unstructured data presented on government websites themselves."**

This became my data-gathering strategy, and it led to one of the weekend's most surprising discoveries.

**"It was really interesting looking at the datasets that are available. I thought it would be quite easy to get government agency email addresses and phone numbers, but that proved very difficult to get."**

The hunt was more challenging than expected. Getting a clean list of official government agency phone numbers and emails proved surprisingly difficult - a reality that would later spark thoughts about the paradox of government accessibility.

**"I found a list of federal contact details on a website as structured details or semi-structured details - they were in a table format."**

For charity information, the ACNC register on data.gov.au was a great start, but it lacked phone numbers. This led to a key architectural insight: a two-step process. First, identify the charity from the official register, then perform a secondary scrape of their linked website to find the actual contact details. To keep the scope manageable, I focused on my local area of Picton, NSW.

**"However, they did not contain mobile numbers or phone numbers. So in this case I had to do a secondary search on linked webpages which allowed me to find contact details. To reduce the scope, I looked at my local area."**

Finally, to build a defense, I needed to understand the attack. I scoured the Australian government's Scamwatch website, collecting details of recent scams to build the other half of my database: a "threat list" of numbers and entities used by fraudsters.

**"We also looked for information on scams. The Australian government keeps a Scamwatch website, so I searched through those to collect a list of 10 scams with details about which agencies or charities were part of that scam."**

By 11:30 PM, I had exceeded my own expectations. I had a solid data foundation with both verified "safe" contacts and known "threat" contacts.

**"So here we now have a list of verified sites and contact numbers for government agencies at local, state and federal level, and we've got from the other side a list of organizations, websites, emails and phone numbers that have been used in scams. That's as far as I got - it was now 11:30 but I felt I had exceeded where I thought I could get to in a single day."**

I went to sleep happy, my brain buzzing with the architecture of the backend pipeline I would build the next day.

---

## Day 2 (Sunday 4 AM): The Midnight Oil and Morning Revelations

Sleep was difficult; the ideas were too exciting. By 4 AM, I was up with a coffee, talking to myself, and marveling at how quickly AI had allowed me to prototype and validate ideas.

**"It was very difficult to sleep. It's now 4 o'clock in the morning and I'm having a coffee, talking to myself to keep a record of where I am in my thoughts. I can't believe how easy it was to prototype and build solutions very quickly to test our ideas."**

This led to a profound realization about the future of development:

**"It just shows where AI is going to help enable individuals to quickly prototype solutions and test ideas. In fact, you could say we're unlimited by our imagination."**

But the 4 AM coffee also sparked another insight about the evolving web ecosystem:

**"I had a thought when I woke up that one of the things that were starting to see is that websites are starting to become AI crawl friendly. Sometimes it's by having markup versions of the sites so I'm going to have to have a Look at that and see if there is a government website hopefully in Australia if not elsewhere that's been set up to make it easy for AI to crawl."**

### The Multi-Agent Vision Takes Shape

My plan for the day was to take my disparate collection of Python scripts and weave them into a single, intelligent, and automated data pipeline. I chose to build this around a multi-agent framework that implements Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, allowing each component to communicate and coordinate tasks.

**"Now I've been using Google [A2A] and ADK... solutions because it's using an underline agent to agent protocol to enhance agents talk together today. I need to take those individual agents and string them together."**

The "Critic" pattern was central to my designâ€”an AI agent whose sole job is to verify the quality and integrity of the data collected by the other agents.

**"I have the idea of using the critic pattern which really is a verification step where it verifies the data sources and checks I built that yesterday... Some of this was just happening naturally just using Claude code now. I need to do it more formally."**

### The Infrastructure Mistakes That Teach Us

Of course, no hackathon is without its hurdles. My biggest mistake, which I should have known better, cost me precious time:

**"Well one thing I found was I really [should have] known better is I didn't set up a Directory structure for front end and backend and data upfront which meant I spent a couple of hours fixing issues related to moving source files into structure that made sense."**

This became a classic hackathon lesson learned the hard way - infrastructure decisions made early (or not made) have cascading effects throughout the project.

### The AI Memory Problem and Solution

I also discovered an interesting quirk of working with an LLM as a co-developer: it can "forget." 

**"Found my agent sometimes or I should say my Claude code would forget the number of agents that existed so I created a file which persisted the valid agents. The old programs and data sets that were no longer the relevant acting as persistent memory to try to ensure [it] didn't forget and use the wrong agents when it was updating the multiagent architecture."**

My solution was to create a SCRAPERS.md file that acted as a persistent memory, explicitly documenting the active and deprecated agents so the AI (and I) would always use the correct ones when updating the pipeline. This became a crucial pattern for working effectively with LLMs on complex projects.

---

## Day 3 (Sunday Morning): The Final Sprint and Mobile Challenge

With a working backend, the final day was all about the user. I set myself a hard deadline to finish all coding and move on to documentation.

**"Phil just had my morning coffee and settle down to an intensive day of work... I've got maybe four hours more development before I start to move towards documentation and closing the project so I'm sending a goal of 9 am to finish your code."**

### Diving into Unknown Waters: SwiftUI and Modern iOS

It's been many, many years since I last programmed a mobile app, and the landscape has completely changed. I was diving into SwiftUI and other frameworks I'd never heard of.

**"It's been many many many years since I last programmed a mobile app [and the] whole use of a user interface Framework has completely changed since [I] last program[med] on mobiles and then I'm using Library that I've never heard of so it'll be really interesting to see how far Claude code or some of the other AI can help me."**

This is where AI truly shone as a development partner:

**"It's been surprising with what the power of a few screen prints on errors in Xcode how [it] can naturally manage those and deal with those."**

The ability to share screenshots of errors and get intelligent guidance was transformative for navigating unfamiliar territory.

### The Icon That Was Off by One Pixel

Even simple tasks had their quirks:

**"I also use Google Gemini to create an icon for me and it really did step it up and then I converted it to dark and light and tint whatever that is and [it worked] fantastically [but] it was Off by one pixel which I had to delete [because] the icon Wasn't working so [there's a] lesson there as well."**

### Simulating Reality: APNS and Testing Challenges

**"A little bit challenging was trying to figure out had a simulate SMS messages. Phone calls incoming phone calls, but there were techniques to do that so that's been pretty cool so APNS for example asked me to have a Jason structure which I can drag into the simulator to actually [simulate] a call."**

Simulating the real-world conditions of a scam was another interesting challenge. Learning to use APNS (Apple Push Notification service) payloads to create fake incoming phone calls and SMS messages in the simulator allowed me to test the app's core functionality.

### The SMS Protection Breakthrough

The SMS protection feature became a point of particular pride:

**"Well I got the [SMS] scam protection working really quickly with surprise me... It was interesting how convoluted it was to get the SMS protection extensions to work the P list that had to be created and the view controllers on the app groups. There's no way I could've done that without instructions would've taken me hours if I'd followed the notoriously poor Apple developer website."**

Getting the iOS Share Extension, App Groups, and View Controllers to work together is genuinely convoluted. Without AI guidance, this would have taken hours of sifting through notoriously poor developer documentation.

This sparked a thought about the future of development:

**"[It would] be interesting [in the] future[s] like we have agents writing documentation for vendors on the website and then [we'll] be using LMS to read those to figure out How we get them to work."**

### The Core ML Stretch Goal

With the core features working, I made a run at a stretch goal: getting a small language model running on the device to query the data.

**"Now seeing if I can do a stretch which is to get the Core ML small language model downloaded onto my phone and then also get it to access a clean version of my CSV file in [a] JSON format for inquiries so that will show data extracted using a mixture of agents and Python scripts Being loaded into a mobile phone and then [queried] through [a] language [model]. How cool is that!"**

After struggling to find a compatible model:

**"I've really been struggling to find a ML large language model that will run on my iPhone from Hugging Face and I've just been searching through apple's official documentation but it looks after two hours of searching that I found it."**

It was a thrilling, if time-consuming, diversion that ultimately succeeded, demonstrating real on-device AI capabilities.

## Reflections: What This Weekend Revealed

This weekend was a fantastic, exhausting, and revealing experience that illuminated several key insights about the future of development and the current capabilities of AI-assisted programming.

### AI as a Force Multiplier, Not a Replacement

**"It's been fantastic experience so far trying to develop an application by myself really does show the power of these [new] tools like Claude code which allows you to be pretty self-sufficient."**

It's undeniable. Generative AI allows a single person to ideate, prototype, and execute at the speed of a small team. I could never have built both a multi-agent backend and a native iOS app in 48 hours without it. But this isn't about replacement - it's about amplification.

### The Human Remains the Architect

AI is a powerful tool, but it's not a replacement for good planning. My failure to set up a clean directory structure early on cost me hours that no amount of AI could get back. The human developer still needs to think architecturally and make foundational decisions that AI cannot make independently.

**"There are some things I'm happy about where it took shortcuts and co[de] development which I wasn't aware of until much later, which caused a lot work And wasted time but I know now for the future which is one of the reasons I wanted to learn and try this out."**

### AI Has Memory Gaps (And We Can Work Around Them)

The "forgetfulness" of the LLM is a real limitation that manifests in practical ways:

**"My agent sometimes or I should say my Claude code would forget the number of agents that existed so I created a file which persisted the valid agents."**

Learning to work around this by creating external "memory" documents or providing very clear context is a new and essential skill for AI-assisted development. The SCRAPERS.md file became more than documentation - it became a shared memory system.

### The Paradox of Government Accessibility

One of the most surprising hurdles was the difficulty in finding official contact details:

**"It's ridiculous that there isn't an easy, machine-readable register of contacts for state and federal government. It's almost like they don't really want to talk to us!"**

The ACNC charity website, for example, has robust robot protection. On one hand, this is fantasticâ€”it shows a commitment to protecting charities from data harvesting. On the other, it highlights a broader problem. People will always find workarounds to get contact information, so we should acknowledge that reality and make official data easier to access for legitimate purposes.

### A Glimpse into the Future of Data

**"Websites are slowly becoming more 'AI-crawl-friendly,' using things like schema markup to structure their data for machines."**

This project relied on scraping human-readable sites, but the future of this kind of work will be in consuming data that's designed to be read by AI, which could make these data pipelines infinitely more powerful and reliable.

### The Development Partnership Model

What emerged was less "human using AI" and more "human-AI partnership." The AI excelled at:
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Navigating unfamiliar frameworks (SwiftUI, CallKit)
- Debugging through screenshots
- Code generation for specific patterns

The human remained essential for:
- Architectural decisions
- Problem definition and scope
- Quality judgment and trade-offs
- Persistent memory and context management
- Understanding user needs and constraints

### The Technical Achievements That Matter

By the end of the weekend, what we had built together was remarkable:

**Backend Pipeline Results:**
- 415 total contact records processed across 5 specialized AI agents
- 402 verified safe contacts (96.9% safety rate)
- 13 threat indicators identified and catalogued
- Grade A data quality (95.4% accuracy score)
- 100% pipeline success rate

**Mobile Application Results:**
- Native iOS app with CallKit integration for real-time call monitoring
- Share Extension for SMS analysis across any iOS app
- Family Circle protection with safe word verification
- On-device Core ML model (OpenELM-270M) processing government data
- Complete privacy-first architecture with zero network calls for AI processing

**Innovation Demonstrated:**
- Google Agent2Agent protocol implementation with real government data
- Multi-agent coordination with task delegation and error handling
- Hybrid approach combining structured APIs with unstructured web scraping
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system on mobile devices
- Real-time threat intelligence cross-referencing

### The Meta-Learning About AI Development

Perhaps the most valuable insight was about the process itself. AI-assisted development isn't just fasterâ€”it enables different types of exploration and risk-taking. When you can prototype an idea in minutes rather than hours, you can explore more possibilities. When you can get immediate feedback on unfamiliar APIs through screenshots, you can venture into territories you'd normally avoid.

**"Can't believe how easy it was to prototype building solutions very quickly to test our ideas. It just shows where AI is going to help enable individuals to quickly prototype solutions and test ideas. In fact you could say [we're] unlimited by their imagination."**

But this speed comes with new responsibilities. The ability to build quickly means the quality of your architectural decisions becomes even more critical. The ability to generate code rapidly means you need better judgment about what code to accept or modify.

### The Joy of Building

**"Time to get going. Another cup of coffee has been poured and Time to start."**

Despite the technical challenges and time pressure, there's an undeniable joy that runs through the development notes. The excitement of ideas clicking into place, the satisfaction of solving complex integration problems, the thrill of seeing real AI running on a mobile device with government data.

**"How cool is that!"** appears multiple times in the notes, capturing something essential about the hackathon experience - the pure joy of creation and discovery.

## The Human Stories Behind the Code

### The 4 AM Breakthrough Moment

**"Well it was very difficult to sleep. It's now 4 o'clock in the morning and I'm having a coffee talking to myself... can't believe how easy it was to prototype building solutions very quickly to test our ideas."**

There's something uniquely hackathon about this moment - the inability to sleep because the ideas are too exciting, the coffee at 4 AM, the talking to yourself to process the possibilities. This captures the intersection of human creativity and AI capability that defined the weekend.

### The Directory Structure Learning Moment

**"Well one thing I found was I really [should have] known better is I didn't set up a Directory structure for front end and backend and data upfront which meant I spent a couple of hours fixing issues."**

This honest admission reveals an important truth: even with AI acceleration, fundamental software engineering principles matter. The AI could help fix the problems caused by poor initial structure, but it couldn't prevent the time lost to refactoring.

### The Persistent Memory Innovation

**"Found my agent sometimes or I should say my Claude code would forget the number of agents that existed so I created a file which persisted the valid agents... acting as persistent memory to try to ensure [it] didn't forget."**

This represents a genuine innovation in human-AI collaboration patterns. The SCRAPERS.md file became more than documentation - it became a shared memory system that enabled more effective long-term collaboration with AI systems.

### The Government Data Accessibility Paradox

**"It's ridiculous that there isn't an easy, machine-readable register of contacts for state and federal government. It's almost like they don't really want to talk to us!"**

This frustration led to a deeper insight about the tension between accessibility and security in government data. The technical challenge became a policy observation about how governments balance openness with protection.

## Lessons for the Future of Solo Development

### What This Proves About AI-Assisted Development

1. **Speed Without Sacrificing Quality:** The ability to achieve Grade A data quality (95.4%) while building both a multi-agent backend and native mobile app in 48 hours demonstrates that AI assistance doesn't require compromising on standards.

2. **Cross-Domain Capability:** Moving between Python data processing, iOS development, and government data integration within a single project shows how AI can enable developers to work effectively across unfamiliar domains.

3. **Real-World Problem Solving:** The $3.1 billion annual cost of scams in Australia represents a genuine social problem that a solo developer could meaningfully address using AI assistance.

### The New Skills Required

Working effectively with AI as a development partner requires developing new capabilities:

**Memory Management:** Creating external artifacts (like SCRAPERS.md) to maintain context across long development sessions.

**Architectural Thinking:** Since AI can implement quickly, the quality of high-level design decisions becomes even more critical.

**Quality Judgment:** With AI generating code rapidly, the ability to assess, modify, and integrate that code becomes essential.

**Problem Scoping:** The ability to define clear, achievable goals becomes more important when you can potentially build anything.

### What Hasn't Changed

Despite the AI assistance, several traditional development challenges remained:

**Infrastructure Decisions:** Early architectural choices (like directory structure) still had cascading effects throughout the project.

**Domain Knowledge:** Understanding the problem space (scam prevention, government data, iOS development) remained essential.

**User Empathy:** Designing for vulnerable populations required human insight into their needs and capabilities.

**Quality Standards:** Maintaining high standards for data quality, security, and accessibility required constant human oversight.

## Conclusions: What 48 Hours of AI-Assisted Development Teaches Us

This weekend proved several important points about the current state and future potential of AI-assisted development:

### The Partnership Model Works

The most effective approach wasn't "human uses AI" or "AI replaces human," but rather a true partnership where each contributed their strengths. The AI excelled at rapid implementation, debugging assistance, and navigating unfamiliar APIs. The human provided architectural vision, quality judgment, problem definition, and user empathy.

### Speed Enables Different Types of Innovation

When you can prototype and test ideas in minutes rather than hours, it changes what kinds of projects become feasible for solo developers. Complex, multi-component systems that would normally require teams become achievable for individuals with the right AI assistance.

### Infrastructure and Architecture Matter More, Not Less

The ability to build quickly actually makes good foundational decisions more critical. When you can implement rapidly, the quality of your early architectural choices determines whether you'll spend time building features or fighting technical debt.

### Quality Doesn't Have to Suffer

The Grade A (95.4%) data quality score achieved while building at hackathon speed demonstrates that AI assistance can actually improve quality when properly managed. The Critic Agent pattern of having AI validate AI-generated work proved particularly effective.

### New Collaboration Patterns Are Emerging

The need for persistent memory files, the importance of clear context management, and the value of treating AI as a development partner rather than a tool all point to emerging best practices for human-AI collaboration.

### Real-World Impact Remains the Goal

Despite all the technical innovation, the most important measure was whether the system would actually help protect vulnerable Australians from scams. The 410 verified contacts, the privacy-first architecture, and the accessibility-focused design all aimed at solving a genuine social problem.
