# Using AI to Help Australians Navigate Government Services
Jurisdiction: Australia
#Smarter-services


How might we use AI to make it easier for people to access, understand and engage with the government services and supports they need - when they need them?

From birth of a child to job loss, to becoming a carer - people interact with government services during some of life’s most critical moments. But navigating the complexity of supports, eligibility rules and information sources can be confusing and fragmented.
Key information is scattered across many different sources, requiring individuals to have the skills and means to search for, make sense of, and access the right support. For many, this journey can be confusing and overwhelming, leaving them feeling powerless.
For example, people go through major planned or unplanned ‘life events’, such as birth of a child or recovering from a natural disaster, which require interactions with government services provided by different agencies or tiers of government.

This challenge invites participants to explore how generative AI can improve government services - making them more accessible, intuitive, and responsive to the needs of the public.

‘Better services’ might mean more inclusive design, life-event-based support, faster support, seamless navigation between agencies, or smarter mobile friendly tools that support digital self-service. Participants are encouraged to think about government services broadly - think big, challenge assumptions, and design with empathy.

Please note the example datasets are a starting point – you are welcome to incorporate other data sources.

Bonus points for ideas that are consistent with the AI Technical Standards design statements (see https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/AI-technical-standard/technical-standard-governments-use-artificial-intelligence-design).

Eligibility: Open to all. Additional bonuses are available for ideas that are consistent with the AI Technical Standards design statements.

Entry: Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

# Digital Confidence: Tools for Safe Online Participation
Jurisdiction: International
#Navigating-the-digital-seas


How can communities, governments and organisations enhance digital safety and trust to protect vulnerable populations and enable secure, meaningful engagement with digital platforms and data?

Digital technologies are the backbone of modern society, enabling communication, services, governance, and innovation. However, this growing reliance comes with increasing risks:
- Cyber threats such as fraud, phishing, identity theft, and ransomware are more sophisticated and widespread.
- Misinformation and disinformation are undermining public trust, eroding social cohesion, and influencing decision-making.
- AI-enabled harms, from deepfakes to automated scams, amplify risks by making attacks faster, cheaper, and harder to detect.
- Vulnerable populations (children, elderly, minority groups, digitally inexperienced) face disproportionate risks in navigating digital ecosystems

Your challenge is to develop strategies, tools, and frameworks that foster digital trust, enabling people and organisations to navigate online environments confidently and safely. Trust is the foundation for meaningful participation: without it, uptake of digital government, online services, and community engagement will continue to be fragmented.
Some key areas to consider are:
- Detection & protection: How can we better distribute information on and mitigate cyber threats, fraud, and AI-enabled harms in real time?
- Trust & integrity: Are there mechanisms to uphold information authenticity and prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation?
- Inclusion & protection of vulnerable groups: Do solutions exist to safeguard high risk groups and enable inclusive and equitable access e.g., children, elderly, digitally disadvantaged?
- Governance & responsibility: What frameworks can balance accountability between governments, platforms, and individuals?
- Digital literacy & empowerment: How can communities and organisations be equipped with the knowledge and tools to navigate online spaces confidently?

Teams taking up this challenge should aim to produce practical, innovative, and scalable solutions that address one or more of the above questions.

In particular, you are expected to produce
- A practical plan that is implementable whilst addressing accessibility, ethical, privacy or trust concerns
- A way to use at least one Government dataset or finding
- Specific examples or simulations to illustrate the effectiveness and potential impact of your proposed solutions. Ideally, you should demonstrate how your solution can be scaled or adapted to a range of scenarios
- A presentation summarising your solution

Eligibility: Open to all. Your solution will be measured against its relevance to the theme, practicality and scalability, whether it follows ethical and inclusive design, and its innovation. You must use at least one Government dataset.

Entry: Challenge entry is available to all teams in Competition 2025.

# Community AI Agents: Bridging Service Access Gaps
Jurisdiction: Australia
#Empower #Connect #Include


How can we design Agentic AI solutions that autonomously assist residents in discovering, accessing, and engaging with local government and community services?

As communities grow more diverse, the complexity of accessing government and social services increases. Many residents lack the time, knowledge, or digital skills to navigate these systems. The advent of AI agents, which are 'virtual coworkers' that can act autonomously to execute tasks, interact with both humans and systems, and adapt in real time offers a tremendous opportunity to support the community such as in accessing government services. For example, imagine an AI agent that not only tells you where the nearest food bank is but also books a slot, sends reminders, and connects you with volunteers that can answer your questions on the food bank service.

This challenge invites participants to build Agentic AI agents that act as personal community assistants for identifying needs, finding solutions, and executing tasks. The solution should demonstrate autonomy, adaptability, and inclusivity, ensuring it works for digitally excluded populations.

Guiding questions include:
- How can Agentic AI agents proactively identify community needs and connect residents to relevant government or local services without requiring complex user input?
- What strategies can ensure these AI agents are inclusive and accessible for people with low digital literacy, language barriers, or disabilities?
- How can the AI agent autonomously perform multi-step tasks (e.g., booking appointments, filling forms, sending reminders) while maintaining user trust, security, and data privacy?
- What mechanisms can be implemented for the AI agent to continuously learn and adapt to changing community needs and service availability?
- How can the solution foster social cohesion beyond just providing information—by encouraging engagement, collaboration, and mutual support within the community?

You are expected to deliver:
- A specific proposal that addresses how AI can make government and community services more accessible
- A detailed model or plan that integrates AI to improve services. Ensure the plan addresses ethical, privacy, and trust concerns while being practical and caters for digitally excluded groups (e.g., elderly, migrants, low-income households)
- Specific examples or simulations to illustrate the effectiveness and potential impact of your proposed solutions. Demonstrate how your solution can be scaled or adapted to different public sector contexts
- A presentation summarising your solution

Eligibility: Open to all. Your solution will be measured against its relevance to the theme, practicality and scalability, whether it follows ethical and inclusive design, and its innovation. You must use at least one Government dataset.

Entry: Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.
