🔍 How the Critic Agent Works

  The Critic Agent is an AI-powered data quality reviewer that analyzes our
  standardized contact dataset using multiple validation layers:

  1. Data Quality Framework

  quality_weights = {
      'format_compliance': 30%,    # Phone/email/URL format validation
      'completeness': 25%,         # Required vs optional field coverage  
      'source_reliability': 20%,   # Trustworthiness of data sources
      'consistency': 15%,          # Duplicate detection & cross-checks
      'freshness': 10%            # How recently data was collected
  }

  2. Format Validation Rules

  Phone Numbers:
  - Australian format regex: ^(\+61|0)[2-9]\d{8}$|^(1800|1300|13)\d{6}$|^13\d{4}$
  - Detects suspicious patterns (e.g., "0000", repeated digits)
  - Result: 96.7% of 397 phones passed validation

  Email Addresses:
  - Standard email regex: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
  - Identifies government domains (.gov.au)
  - Result: 100% of 10 emails passed validation

  Websites:
  - URL format validation: ^https?://.+\..+$
  - Government domain detection (.gov.au)
  - HTTPS security check
  - Result: 100% of 6 websites passed validation

  3. Completeness Analysis

  required_fields = ['contact_value', 'organization_name', 'organization_type',
  'source_agent']
  optional_fields = ['address', 'suburb', 'state', 'services']
  - 98% completeness rate - almost all records have required fields
  - Flags missing critical data for improvement

  4. Source Reliability Scoring

  source_reliability_scores = {
      'nsw_hospitals_agent': 95%,        # Official API
      'government_services_scraper': 90%, # Official directory
      'scamwatch_threat_agent': 85%,     # Official scam reporting
      'nsw_government_scraper': 85%,     # Official NSW directory
      'acnc_data_agent': 80%             # Official charity register
  }

  5. Inconsistency Detection

  - Duplicate Contact Analysis: Finds same phone/email used by multiple organizations
  - Organization Name Variations: Detects potential naming inconsistencies
  - Address Validation: Cross-checks address formats

  6. Quality Score Calculation

  Final score combines all components:
  Overall Score = (Format×30% + Completeness×25% + Reliability×20% + Consistency×15% +
   Freshness×10%)

  7. Report Generation

  The Critic outputs:
  - JSON Quality Report: Detailed findings and statistics
  - Recommendations: Specific improvements for data pipeline
  - Letter Grade: A-F scoring for easy interpretation
  - Component Breakdown: Shows which areas need attention

  Why This Approach Works:

  1. Multi-layered Validation: Catches different types of quality issues
  2. Weighted Scoring: Prioritizes most critical quality factors
  3. Actionable Feedback: Provides specific recommendations for improvement
  4. Standards Compliance: Uses official Australian contact format rules
  5. Scalable: Can handle datasets from hundreds to thousands of records

  Result: Our 415-record dataset scored 95% (Grade A) with high confidence that the
  data is reliable for anti-scam verification purposes.
🚀 Multi-Agent Framework Completion Plan

  I have the foundation with agent_framework.py but need to finish 3 key components:

  Current Status:

  ✅ BaseAgent class with A2A message protocol✅ CoordinatorAgent with pipeline
  orchestration✅ A2AMessage format following Google ADK spec🔄 Need to complete:
  Sorter Agent + full pipeline testing

  Phase 1: Complete the Sorter Agent

  class SorterAgent(BaseAgent):
      """Categorizes and prioritizes contact data by risk/type"""

      # Sort by:
      # - Organization type (government/hospital/charity/threat)
      # - Contact type (phone/email/website) 
      # - Risk level (safe/suspicious/threat)
      # - Geographic region (Federal/NSW/Local)
      # - Confidence score (high/medium/low)

  Phase 2: Enhance Agent Communication

  # Message Types to implement:
  - TASK_REQUEST: "Start collecting data"
  - TASK_RESPONSE: "Collection complete, 109 records found"
  - DATA_TRANSFER: "Sending standardized dataset"
  - QUALITY_REPORT: "Data quality score: 95%"
  - ERROR_REPORT: "Failed to access NSW API"

  Phase 3: Pipeline Orchestration

  # Execution Flow:
  1. Coordinator → Collectors: "Start data collection"
  2. Collectors → Coordinator: "Data ready" + record counts
  3. Coordinator → Standardizer: "Merge all datasets"
  4. Standardizer → Critic: "Review quality"
  5. Critic → Coordinator: "Quality report + grade"
  6. Coordinator → Sorter: "Categorize final data"
  7. Sorter → Output: Generate categorized CSVs by type/risk

  Phase 4: Error Handling & Recovery

  - Agent timeout handling
  - Failed task retry logic
  - Partial data recovery
  - Quality threshold enforcement

  Expected Outputs:

  government_contacts.csv     - 131 verified gov contacts
  hospital_contacts.csv       - 266 NSW hospitals
  charity_contacts.csv        - 5 Picton charities
  threat_indicators.csv       - 13 scam numbers
  pipeline_execution_log.json - Full agent communication trace

  Demo Flow:

  python agent_framework.py
  # → Shows real-time A2A messages between agents
  # → Displays pipeline progress with success/failure rates  
  # → Outputs categorized datasets ready for anti-scam use

  This demonstrates Google Agent2Agent protocol working with real Australian 
  government data for GovHack judges!
