🔍 How the Critic Agent Works

  The Critic Agent is an AI-powered data quality reviewer that analyzes our
  standardized contact dataset using multiple validation layers:

  1. Data Quality Framework

  quality_weights = {
      'format_compliance': 30%,    # Phone/email/URL format validation
      'completeness': 25%,         # Required vs optional field coverage  
      'source_reliability': 20%,   # Trustworthiness of data sources
      'consistency': 15%,          # Duplicate detection & cross-checks
      'freshness': 10%            # How recently data was collected
  }

  2. Format Validation Rules

  Phone Numbers:
  - Australian format regex: ^(\+61|0)[2-9]\d{8}$|^(1800|1300|13)\d{6}$|^13\d{4}$
  - Detects suspicious patterns (e.g., "0000", repeated digits)
  - Result: 96.7% of 397 phones passed validation

  Email Addresses:
  - Standard email regex: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
  - Identifies government domains (.gov.au)
  - Result: 100% of 10 emails passed validation

  Websites:
  - URL format validation: ^https?://.+\..+$
  - Government domain detection (.gov.au)
  - HTTPS security check
  - Result: 100% of 6 websites passed validation

  3. Completeness Analysis

  required_fields = ['contact_value', 'organization_name', 'organization_type',
  'source_agent']
  optional_fields = ['address', 'suburb', 'state', 'services']
  - 98% completeness rate - almost all records have required fields
  - Flags missing critical data for improvement

  4. Source Reliability Scoring

  source_reliability_scores = {
      'nsw_hospitals_agent': 95%,        # Official API
      'government_services_scraper': 90%, # Official directory
      'scamwatch_threat_agent': 85%,     # Official scam reporting
      'nsw_government_scraper': 85%,     # Official NSW directory
      'acnc_data_agent': 80%             # Official charity register
  }

  5. Inconsistency Detection

  - Duplicate Contact Analysis: Finds same phone/email used by multiple organizations
  - Organization Name Variations: Detects potential naming inconsistencies
  - Address Validation: Cross-checks address formats

  6. Quality Score Calculation

  Final score combines all components:
  Overall Score = (Format×30% + Completeness×25% + Reliability×20% + Consistency×15% +
   Freshness×10%)

  7. Report Generation

  The Critic outputs:
  - JSON Quality Report: Detailed findings and statistics
  - Recommendations: Specific improvements for data pipeline
  - Letter Grade: A-F scoring for easy interpretation
  - Component Breakdown: Shows which areas need attention

  Why This Approach Works:

  1. Multi-layered Validation: Catches different types of quality issues
  2. Weighted Scoring: Prioritizes most critical quality factors
  3. Actionable Feedback: Provides specific recommendations for improvement
  4. Standards Compliance: Uses official Australian contact format rules
  5. Scalable: Can handle datasets from hundreds to thousands of records

  Result: Our 415-record dataset scored 95% (Grade A) with high confidence that the
  data is reliable for anti-scam verification purposes.
🚀 Multi-Agent Framework Completion Plan

  I have the foundation with agent_framework.py but need to finish 3 key components:

   Perfect! The directory path issues have been completely resolved. The pipeline
  now works correctly when using a virtual environment. Here's a summary of what
  was fixed:

  ✅ Directory Path Issues - RESOLVED

  The Problem: After restructuring the project into backend/, data/, and frontend/
   directories, the multi-agent framework couldn't find the individual agent
  scripts because it was looking for them at the old locations.

  Root Causes Found:
  1. Agent Registration: CollectorAgentProxy objects were registered with new
  paths, but...
  2. Hardcoded Task List: The coordinator had a hardcoded collector_tasks list
  with old script paths
  3. Script Execution Paths: References to critic_agent.py, sorter_agent.py, and
  data_standardizer.py used old paths
  4. Virtual Environment: The scripts run as separate processes and need access to
   installed packages

  Solutions Applied:
  1. Updated script paths in the coordinator's collector_tasks list:
  collector_tasks = [
      ('government_services_scraper', 'backend/agents/gov_services_scraper.py'),
      ('nsw_hospitals_agent', 'backend/agents/nsw_hospitals_agent.py'),
      ('scamwatch_threat_agent', 'backend/agents/scamwatch_threat_agent.py'),
  ]
  2. Fixed processing agent paths:
    - data_standardizer.py → backend/utils/data_standardizer.py
    - critic_agent.py → backend/agents/critic_agent.py
    - sorter_agent.py → backend/agents/sorter_agent.py
  3. Updated README.md to emphasize virtual environment requirement and correct
  usage

  Test Results - 100% SUCCESS ✅:
  - ✅ 3/3 collector agents completed
  - ✅ Data standardization completed
  - ✅ Quality review completed (Grade A, 0.96 score)
  - ✅ Data sorting completed (375 safe contacts, 13 threat indicators)
  - ✅ Pipeline Success Rate: 100.0%

  Instructions for users:
  1. Must use virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate
  2. Then run: python backend/run_pipeline.py
  3. For testing with fresh data: Clear data files first as documented in README

  The multi-agent framework is now fully operational with the new directory
  structure! 🎉


   ✅ File Organization Issue - COMPLETELY RESOLVED!

  The Problem: Files were saving to the root directory instead of the organized
  data/ folder structure, making the project messy and defeating the purpose of
  the directory restructuring.

  Root Cause: All agents had hardcoded filenames that defaulted to the current
  working directory (root) instead of using the intended data/ subdirectory
  structure.

  Complete Solution Applied:

  1. Raw Data Collection (data/raw/)

  - gov_services_scraper.py: government_services.csv →
  data/raw/government_services.csv
  - nsw_hospitals_agent.py: nsw_hospitals.csv → data/raw/nsw_hospitals.csv
  - scamwatch_threat_agent.py: scamwatch_threats.csv →
  data/raw/scamwatch_threats.csv

  2. Reports (data/reports/)

  - critic_agent.py: critic_report.json → data/reports/critic_report.json
  - sorter_agent.py: sorter_report.json → data/reports/sorter_report.json
  - agent_framework.py: pipeline_report.json → data/reports/pipeline_report.json

  3. Processed Data (data/)

  - data_standardizer.py: standardized_contacts.csv →
  data/standardized_contacts.csv
  - sorter_agent.py: sorted_contacts_master.csv → data/sorted_contacts_master.csv

  4. Verified Contacts (data/verified/)

  - government_contacts.csv → data/verified/government_contacts.csv
  - hospital_contacts.csv → data/verified/hospital_contacts.csv
  - high_priority_contacts.csv → data/verified/high_priority_contacts.csv

  5. Threat Intelligence (data/threats/)

  - threat_contacts.csv → data/threats/threat_contacts.csv

  6. Updated Framework References

  - Fixed agent_framework.py to read reports from data/reports/
  - Updated message payloads to reference correct file paths
  - Updated data_standardizer to read from data/raw/ directory

  Final Result:

  - ✅ Clean directory structure - No more files cluttering root directory
  - ✅ Professional organization - Files properly categorized by purpose
  - ✅ 100% Pipeline Success - All agents working with new paths
  - ✅ Easy navigation - Clear separation of raw, processed, verified, and threat
  data
  - ✅ README matches reality - Documentation accurately reflects file locations

  The project now has the professional directory structure that was intended from
  the restructuring! 🎉
